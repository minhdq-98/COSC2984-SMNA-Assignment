      "Supplication is one of the best cures for diseases of the heart. Communicate with your heart &amp; soul. Get close to the Almighty. He will grant comfort. Don‚Äôt search for happiness in a place where you will not find it. Know that true happiness comes from Him and it lasts forever.\n",
      "Sometimes the Almighty sends you blessings disguised in what you see as ugly packages. He wants to see your response. Will you give thanks &amp; embrace the whole process or judge it at face value &amp; react adversely to it? Don‚Äôt lose the plot. Don‚Äôt let Satan make you ungrateful!\n",
      "The trials that come your way can make you better or bitter. They can make you grow up or give up. The Almighty‚Äôs watching your response. Have you got what it takes to go through tough trials? Will you bear good patience with a soft heart or will your heart harden in the process?\n",
      "Do you keep going round in circles? Do you feel like you‚Äôre moving but not making any progress? Then you have to stop doing what you‚Äôre doing &amp; take stock of your life. Reevaluate your priorities &amp; shift your mindset. Get out of the rut. Seek your strength from the Almighty.\n",
      "Don‚Äôt let your fears and worries crush you. Never feel alone in your internal panic. The Almighty knows every single thing about you. Keep asking Him. Keep confiding in Him. Let go of the worry that‚Äôs gripping you. Let Him take over and feel a sense of calm restored in you!\n",
      "What is this life but a series of obstacles? The good news is nothing happens without the Almighty‚Äôs Will. If anything unpleasant comes into your life, it had to get approval from Him. He knows the kind of test you need. He‚Äôs placed a blessing inside of it. It‚Äôs for your good!\n",
      "Life can be difficult if all you see is everything that‚Äôs wrong. Start focusing on what‚Äôs right, what‚Äôs good, what‚Äôs constructive. No matter what you‚Äôre facing, if you choose a positive mindset, you‚Äôll emerge the winner. So if you want to feel better, you‚Äôve got to think better!\n",
      "Stop investing in your past. It‚Äôs over. Let it go. The Almighty has paved a way for you to move forward. Don‚Äôt be so engrossed with what was &amp; what has been that you forget to acknowledge His Blessing for what is &amp; what‚Äôs to come. Read the signs &amp; make that change to your life!\n",
      "Learn to be at peace with what the Almighty has chosen for you. If we allow that peace to reign in our hearts, our worldly stresses will dissipate &amp; disappear. Don‚Äôt allow unanswered prayers for the moment to cause anger or bitterness. He has the best answer &amp; solution always!\n",
      "Are you always unhappy &amp; discontented with life? If you are check yourself for these symptoms. Are you always criticising others; complaining that your life isn‚Äôt good enough; quick to condemn people or comparing yourself with your neighbours? Stop all that &amp; feel the difference!\n",
      "Almighty. Grant us tranquility &amp; hope in this pandemic that seems far from over. Many are confused &amp; helpless as nations go back into lockdown. Keep us thankful always as many are suffering a lot more than us. We ask You for beautiful patience to endure what lies ahead. Aameen!\n",
      "Alimighty. Help us get rid of jealousy &amp; envy from our hearts. They‚Äôre the cause of many of today‚Äôs woes. Help us understand that envy eats &amp; rots the heart. Forgive us when we grumble how You bless others. Help us avoid comparison &amp; learn to be at peace with Your Blessings.\n",
      "Anger is a choice. We can choose to retreat into our own minds and calm down or we can explode. Anger takes a lot of energy. Fighting, using derogatory words and showing acts of violence don‚Äôt solve any problem. Instead, take a step back, rationalise and seek the Almighty‚Äôs help!\n",
      "When you have a grateful heart, you have everything. You acknowledge the goodness in your life. The Almighty will grant you more. He will increase your sustenance; ease your affairs; open doors you never thought possible. He will make you feel abundant rather than deprived!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt expect everyone to react the way you do when confronted with a difficult situation. Remember, we have all been brought up differently and have different life experiences. This will determine our reaction to various situations. So be kind always and remember we all struggle!\n",
      "We are humans and we are prone to mistakes and sins. Never mind how many times you‚Äôve sinned but the biggest mistake is to lose hope in the Almighty‚Äôs Mercy. Keep repenting. Keep turning back to Him. Always believe that He will forgive you. This is what sets us apart from Satan!\n",
      "People expect instant miracles everyday. Not everything in life is like that. You have to go through a process. We have become impatient when supplicating, expecting instant response. The Almighty doesn‚Äôt work like that. We need to learn patience, live a life of gratitude.\n",
      "Avoid suspicion. It‚Äôs a trait of Satan and detested by the Almighty. It stems from a heart that is insecure and always full of doubt. At its worst, it can turn into hate; harming people and destroying relationships. Counter it with optimism, positive thoughts and firm faith!\n",
      "Life is indeed a journey. Successful is he who can navigate the ups and downs without losing his balance. Don‚Äôt dwell on your past, don‚Äôt wallow in self-pity, don‚Äôt repeat your mistakes, don‚Äôt focus on negativity, help others along the way, spread kindness wherever you go!\n",
      "Do good, even what you consider to be insignificant acts. The Almighty sees, hears &amp; knows everything. He will reward you for it. Remember unlike humans, He‚Äôs above glitches, errors &amp; system failures. He is perfect but He doesn‚Äôt expect perfection from us. Only sincere effort!\n",
      "Do you have scars to show? They are proof of inner strength. They show us that we‚Äôre all warriors really; even if we were gasping for air for a while. Scars show what we‚Äôve been through &amp; how strong we are for coming out of it because the Almighty chose to restore us! Thank Him!\n",
      "Quit procrastinating. Stop putting things off. So often in life, we feel like we can delay things &amp; do them much later. But we may never have the same opportunities again. This life is so transient. Here today, gone tomorrow. You‚Äôve seen that happen. So best to do it now!\n",
      "When someone wrongs you, instead of retaliating, learn to respond with kindness &amp; patience. It‚Äôs possible if you set your heart &amp; mind to it. If the Almighty is gracious to you why can‚Äôt you do the same to others? Be compassionate. No one knows what others are going through.\n",
      "Every now and then, life will throw you a curveball when you least expect it. The Almighty sends them to disrupt your daily, comfortable routine. They‚Äôre a blessing in disguise. You‚Äôll eventually realize. He‚Äôs watching to see if you‚Äôve got what it takes to pull through!\n",
      "We don‚Äôt deny that money is important. But you don‚Äôt have to go crazy over it. The Almighty has written it down for you, there‚Äôs no need for you to lie, cheat, deceive, resort to fraudulent practices, abuse the rights of others just to make some extra bucks. Greed doesn‚Äôt pay!\n",
      "Stop complaining &amp; start living. It has been a disruptive year with most of our plans put on the back burner but understand that our lives have changed &amp; we won‚Äôt be going back to what it was before the pandemic. Be thankful for what you have &amp; keep moving forward. #newnormal\n",
      "Lower your¬†expectations of others or better still, have zero expectations. That way you‚Äôre less likely to get hurt or disappointed. Rely on none other than the One who made you. Ask from none other than Him. Keep asking. Pray. Your prayers can‚Äôt be answered if you don‚Äôt pray!\n",
      "Almighty. Amid these uncertain times, we thank You for the challenges &amp; struggles; they‚Äôve  brought us closer to You. Amid the darkness, we see Your light; in our fear, we feel Your strength. We pray for compassion &amp; love for others. Keep our hearts attached to You. Aameen!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt rush things in life. The Almighty loves  patience. He makes everything beautiful in His timing, which is always the best. If He‚Äôs making you wait, there‚Äôs a reason. Don‚Äôt let Satan tempt you into believing that the Almighty‚Äôs not listening to your calls. He always listens!\n",
      "If the Almighty wants you to do something, He will give you the ability to carry it out to the best of your ability. Keep believing in yourself and keep Him in focus. Keep your head down and cut out distractions from your life. He will guide you. That‚Äôs how you will succeed!\n",
      "You can choose to either let fear paralyze you or allow your faith to take over &amp; let the Almighty guide you. It can be a daunting task when you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but if you trust Him, He can make the impossible a reality. That‚Äôs His job. Learn to move forward by faith!\n",
      "Have you sincerely repented? When you regret the sins you‚Äôve committed, feel sad for having committed them &amp; feel pain when you remember them, these are signs of sincere repentance. But after this, Satan will cause you to doubt the Almighty‚Äôs Mercy. Don‚Äôt fall for it!\n",
      "Almighty. No matter how many trials You send our way, let us not feel helpless or give up hope because we know You have our backs always. Help us to realise that You‚Äôre our source of peace and we will never be able to attain true peace of mind without You in our lives!\n",
      "If you get back to basics, life is really not that complicated. Try to keep it simple. Stay true to who you are. Don't worry about what other people think of you. They will always have an opinion. Just do your best. Surround yourself with good people. Settle for nothing less!\n",
      "People will usually show their true colours when you‚Äôre in need of help or facing some crisis. Remember, fair-weather friends are aplenty. They hang around you in good times. Their true nature is never shown or disclosed until times of trouble. You‚Äôll know your true friends then!\n",
      "You may be penniless, homeless, unemployed, sick and feel like you have nothing. But you have the one thing that money can't buy: the Almighty. He knows what you want, what you need, what you deserve, at what time &amp; place, trust Him &amp; His decisions. He knows while you don't.\n",

      "Are you guilty of this? Always criticizing others because you‚Äôre impatient? You don‚Äôt tolerate those who behave differently. You expect people to behave like you. When we focus on someone else‚Äôs flaw, we stop seeing the person. We just see their mistakes. Stop this bad habit!\n",
      "Disengage yourself when you find that you‚Äôre in the company of those who love to gossip. It may be hard to get out of it but you must. You don‚Äôt want to be a bad listener, but always remember, you‚Äôre not accountable for their words. Instead, you‚Äôll be taken to task for yours!\n",
      "Breathe a huge sigh of relief &amp;  smile at what the Almighty has blessed you with. Remember, it could always be worse. Learn to look at those who have less than you. That way you will never undervalue His blessings. And when you appreciate what you have, He gives you more!\n",
      "Letting go is incredibly difficult. Some find it hard to move on, clinging on to their past. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Life is all about change. No matter how hard we try to keep things as they are, change will come eventually. So let go when you know you have to!\n",
      "We take tomorrow for granted because we believe tomorrow will always be there. Yes, tomorrow may be there, but remember, we may not! Who said \"tomorrow\" is guaranteed? Make the most of \"today\" that you are blessed with! Yesterday, many thought that they would see today!\n",
      "Maybe the Almighty‚Äôs teaching you how to wait because He wants you to know that you can‚Äôt actually control your life no matter how hard you try. You may think you‚Äôre holding the reins but the truth is you‚Äôre not because that‚Äôs His job, not yours. Lest you forget!\n",
      "Almighty. We pray for healing. The world seems to be spiraling out of control. There‚Äôs widespread mayhem. We even see chaos in our own lives.There are days where we feel demoralized. You're the only One who can lift our spirits &amp; will truly listen. You have all the answers!\n",
      "Almighty. We pray for ease amidst all the suffering going on in the world today. May You comfort every heart that‚Äôs experiencing the heaviness of loss. Only You can heal the brokenness and void left by loved ones gone. It‚Äôs a very trying period for many. Grant us utmost patience!\n",
      "Never doubt that whatever trial  the Almighty sends your way, you‚Äôll be able to handle it. He will never ask you to do something that you can‚Äôt do. He will never test you beyond your capabilities. You are fully equipped, qualified, and capable to face the trials. Trust Him!\n",
      "Why do you resent other people‚Äôs success? The trouble is social media makes it worse. You believe that everyone else is happier &amp; wealthier as you view their posts. Stop comparing yourself to others. Reframe your mindest. your job is to do your best with what you‚Äôve been given!\n",
      "Sometimes the hardest person to correct is yourself. There is no shame in being wrong. We are human and we make mistakes. The shame is in choosing to stay on the wrong path. Make that change, as difficult as you think it is. Take that first step; get back on track!\n",
      "Listen to your instincts. Depending on the state of your piety &amp; heart, they can be your moral compass. If you keep purifying your heart, the Almighty will send you a light to distinguish between truth &amp; falsehood, right &amp; wrong. So pay attention to your gut feel &amp; sixth sense!\n",
      "Good and bad days exist in this journey called life. One day you feel broken, the next day you feel whole. It‚Äôs all part of the Almighty‚Äôs Plan. It‚Äôs teaching us to lay complete trust in Him. Remember, we walk by faith. He will not allow us to break, He will carry us through!\n",
      "Heartbreaking, devastating, tragic, horrific scenes from #Beirut. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with #Lebanon today. The sheer magnitude of the #BeirutExplosions! Almighty, help them overcome such a difficult time. We seek Your Mercy and strength!  #BeirutBlasts\n",
      "We sin &amp; make mistakes daily. Everyone who makes a mistake deserves another chance; we‚Äôre human enough to make a mistake. Therefore, everyone deserves another chance. Imagine, if the Almighty accepts our repentance &amp; is willing to forgive, shouldn‚Äôt we do the same for others?\n",
      "When making tough decisions in life, always be sure you‚Äôll be pleasing the Almighty and not incurring His wrath. That way, you‚Äôll always find yourself guided because at the end of the day, the final judgement is up to Him alone. Don‚Äôt worry what people will think or say!\n",
      "No matter how much you regret it or worry about what happened, the past is over. You can‚Äôt change a thing. But you can come to terms with the fact that everything happens for a reason. Live in the present where the Almighty has given you the options to restore calm to your heart!\n",

      "Intentions play a huge role in our faith. You‚Äôll be rewarded according to your intent. For a ‚Äúpure‚Äù goal, like your deeds to be valid, the intent of the believer must be untainted; free of egoistic self-interest. Otherwise, this outward good deed is pointless with the Almighty!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt hate the experience that shaped you. It‚Äôs what the Almighty wants for you. That‚Äôs why He sends specific tests to each &amp; everyone of us. Everything happens for a reason. You may think it was a painful experience but if you bear patience, you‚Äôll emerge a much stronger person!\n",
      "Are your thoughts and conversation always focusing on people; what‚Äôs going on in their lives, their relationships, their social status etc. If your answer is yes, then you have a serious problem. You need to get out of that mould; focus on yourself rather than others.\n",
      "Have you verified what you posted? Be careful not to post unverified news or suspicions on social media. Unwittingly, you may be responsible for causing problems and grief in people‚Äôs lives. You may also be fanning flames of social unrest. The results can be devastating!\n",
      "Have you ever felt like giving up because the road is too long? Do you feel discouraged &amp; overwhelmed because there‚Äôs hard work to be done? Don‚Äôt be. Remember, you‚Äôre never alone in your journey. The Almighty is with you. Should you trip &amp; fall, shake off the dust &amp; carry on!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt shrink back the minute calamity strikes. Difficulties and challenges are part of life. Stay strong and have firm faith that the Almighty wants something new for you. Perhaps you‚Äôve been stuck in a rut for a while. Whatever it is, embrace it. Remember, hardship makes a man!\n",
      "There‚Äôs so much strife and suffering in the world right now. Don‚Äôt give up hope. Keep praying. Keep supplicating. The Almighty is in control. Remember, He has tested those before us with much more. So bear good patience. It‚Äôs darkest before dawn. That streak of light WILL appear!\n",
      "Learn to walk away from people and situations that threaten your peace of mind, self-respect, values, morals or self- worth. Don‚Äôt argue with them. Don‚Äôt get into a debate with them. It‚Äôs not worth your effort. It‚Äôs also a sign of maturity to stay away from such incidents!\n",
      "Life is short. Instead of quibbling over petty issues, make it a point to touch lives &amp; hearts whenever you get the opportunity. Give, forgive &amp; apologise. If you find difficulty doing it, make a commitment &amp; start on this day of Eid. Channel your energy to things that matter.\n",
      "Almighty. Accept our good deeds &amp; acts of sacrifice. Wipe away our sins &amp; forgive our shortcomings on this Day of Sacrifice. Grant us patience as we face a different world due to the pandemic. Only You know what lies ahead. Keep our hearts light as we entrust our affairs to You!\n",

      "Have you ever stopped to think that the news you‚Äôre spreading about someone might not be true? Slander is dangerous. Don‚Äôt engage in such acts. Remember, if you hear something false or dubious about someone, defend him. The Almighty will defend you in this world &amp; the next.\n",
      "Start by fixing yourself. To do that you need to acknowledge the problem, tackle it head on &amp; resolve the issues within yourself. Aim to be a better version of you &amp; work on it. Shift the focus to yourself. The Almighty will guide you step by step.\n",
      "We may not have control over everything that happens in our lives but we do get to choose how we respond to things. Worry is a choice. Happy is a choice. It‚Äôs all about your attitude and how you wish to view the world. The choice is yours!\n",
      "You can‚Äôt run away from your problems. That‚Äôs right. You can‚Äôt. The Almighty has sent it to you for a purpose. You need to accept it, get to the root of it &amp; solve it. He‚Äôs there to guide you if you seek Him. He‚Äôs waiting to see how you respond. He wants to elevate your status!\n",
      "Take time for self-reflection and introspection. Do it for self-development. But the truth is we‚Äôre too busy &amp; when we‚Äôre not, we‚Äôd rather be analysing people‚Äôs lives based on what we see on social media. Remember, we don‚Äôt learn from experience but from reflecting on them!\n",
      "Everything that happens in your life is preparing you for the next stage. Nothing happens by chance. Everything has been carefully crafted by the Master Planner. Your Creator. It won‚Äôt be a bed of roses but if you trust Him, He will guide you to move forward, one step at a time!\n",
      "Every time you think you‚Äôve  reached a dead end, remember that when you see a wall, the Almighty sees a way; an opportunity. Your faith should keep you going. It tells you that no matter what lies ahead, the Almighty is there to clear the path for you. You have to trust Him!\n",
      "Are you this person? A mature one with a special heart who says that no matter how much someone hurts me, I'll still pray for him. It‚Äôs not easy. Most of us will actually do the reverse; start cursing &amp; swearing the person when this happens. But such people do exist. Respect!\n",
      "Use your mouths for good or bad. The choice is yours. Our words can help if used wisely or they can hurt. Choose to speak kind words that motivate &amp; give hope &amp; encouragement. Speak words of praise &amp; keep the Almighty in focus always. Just don‚Äôt use your words to complain &amp; harm!\n",
      "No matter what you‚Äôre going through, always remember that the Almighty is in full control. He reminds you and shows you His Prowess by putting you in situations which you can‚Äôt control. So bear good patience and accept His Decree knowing that everything will come to pass!\n",
      "Be wary of this trap. It happens to those who want to please everyone around them. They become people-pleasers and do it with such fervour, often jeopardizing their link with the Almighty. Don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs not worth it. Know your priorities. Protect yourself at all costs!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt be mean to people. You really don‚Äôt want to hurt them in such a way that they complain to the Almighty, raise their hands to the Lord of the heavens and seek help from Him.

      "Almighty. We pray for peace in our hearts. Although we‚Äôre not able to carry out the Hajj this year because of the pandemic, we ask You to protect the chosen ones who are on their pilgrimage this year. We ask you to facilitate their journey &amp; keep them safe. Aameen!\n",

The best people often had difficult beginnings. But with patience &amp; good attitude, they have the best ending!\n",
      "Never tire of doing good, even small acts. We often hear people say that no one notices any of the good they do! But the Almighty does. He‚Äôs All-Knowing! So press on &amp; do as much as you can, knowing the ten best days are upon us. Good deeds are magnified &amp; the rewards multiplied!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt waste the #mostblesseddays. Ten days is not a long time so be sure to fill your days with as much good as possible. The Almighty gives us these periods of spiritual boosts throughout the year. So purify your intent, make a plan &amp; you‚Äôre on the way to accomplish much!\n",

      "One of our biggest flaws is pretending to be blind to our own shortcomings but we‚Äôre the first to jump down someone's throat when they make a mistake. Let‚Äôs change that. Learn to be more self-critical instead of always pointing fingers at others. Always start with yourself!\n",
      "The choices you make are yours. You don‚Äôt need to explain yourself to anyone. But a lot of us feel this need to explain ourselves. Perhaps we want to be liked by everyone. Or to fit in with them. Whatever it is, stick to your decisions. If you think you‚Äôre wrong, correct them!\n",
      "If you have problems sleeping at night or suffer from insomnia, use that time to get close to the Almighty in one of the most blessed of prayers. Don‚Äôt waste time on social media or gaming. You need to recognize that your sleeplessness is a gift from Him. Not everyone gets it!\n",

      "Do you find yourself getting more impatient? The truth is social media makes us impatient. It rushes us to want what others have, to be the person you see on your timeline, to live someone else‚Äôs life. Learn to be content with what you have. Appreciate the person that you are.\n",
      "When facing a trial, remember that the Almighty‚Äôs constantly trying to refine us out of His Love &amp; Mercy so that we can attain the highest ranks in Paradise. So quit asking ‚Äúwhy me‚Äù when a calamity strikes. Face it with a good attitude so you don‚Äôt end up frustrated &amp; bitter!\n",
      "Whatever happens in life, keep going. Quitting is NOT an option because quitting is permanent. Setbacks and disappointments are not. They should serve to challenge and motivate you to strive even harder. The rewards are sweeter. Once you give up, that‚Äôs the end of the story!\n",
      "Are you carrying emotional baggage from your past? Remember, it can destroy you if you allow it. The state of your mind is important. If you fill it with hurt, anger, pain, revenge and regrets, it doesn‚Äôt augur  well for your future. Shift your focus. Make a fresh start today.\n",
      "We can all learn to listen more. It sounds simple but listening is a skill, an art &amp; a discipline. Pay attention to what people say. Listen to the words. It‚Äôs coming from the heart. The mouth will reveal what the heart feels. Listening can save you from a whole lot of trouble!\n",
      "What goes around comes around &amp; sometimes the lesson is much harder than what you had expected. You reap what you sow tells you that whatever you do in life surely gets counted. Yes they do. So remember this; no matter how much life gets unfair sometimes, it cannot be unjust.\n",
      "Almighty. Only You know the hardships &amp; pain we‚Äôre going through. We hand over our worries to You as we‚Äôve done before. If not for You, we wouldn‚Äôt be here right now. We ask You to bless those who‚Äôve lost their way. Lead them back to Your Path. We‚Äôre thankful for Your Mercy!\n",
      "Almighty. More than six months on and the pandemic is still with us. Many are prone to fear, anxiety and even despair. We pray for healing for those who are ill. Protect those who are most at risk. Give comfort to those who‚Äôve lost loved ones. We place our total trust in You.\n",
      "Stop jumping to conclusions. Things aren‚Äôt always what they seem. Don‚Äôt be too quick to form an impression. You perceive people who don‚Äôt mean to hurt you as having evil intent. This could affect your mental health in the long term. So do yourself a favour. Think good thoughts!\n",
      "Beware toxic people. They come in many forms. When they can no longer control you, they will devise plans and manipulate how others see you. You‚Äôll feel victimised but try and stay above the fray. Keep your cool. The truth will eventually out. The Almighty will see to it anyway!\n",
      "Learn to detach yourself. From things, events and basically anything that robs you of your peace of mind. Most things worldly fit into this category. Remember, you don‚Äôt need to understand why everything happened the way it did. Let it go and let the Almighty take over!\n",
      "You‚Äôre facing test after test and you‚Äôre at a breaking point. Hold on. Remember, a test can sometimes replace a worse misfortune or it could be a form of protection from something. Take your tests in your stride, knowing the Almighty wants only good for you!\n",
      "The closer you try to get to the Almighty, the harder Satan will work to steer you away. His mission is to create confusion, fear; anxiety &amp; panic over things you can't control. It‚Äôs all part of his plan. You need to be aware. Don‚Äôt let your guard down; not even for a second!\n",
      "We‚Äôre all experts in people‚Äôs lives. Social media has made us such! We claim to know everything about others based on what they post online &amp; what we hear. What we don‚Äôt know, we fabricate. We embellish. We forget we‚Äôll have to account for everything on Judgement Day! Beware!\n",
      "Beware of cancel culture. It happens when a celebrity or public figure is said to have done or uttered something offensive. A public backlash, often fueled by social media follows. Then the calls to cancel the person; to end their career.  Don‚Äôt be rash &amp; act without evidence!\n",
      "You‚Äôre getting anxious &amp; having doubts, wondering if the Almighty hears your supplications. You forget that He knows what‚Äôs in your heart. He knows what you want even before you asked Him. Yet, He listens to every word, every plea that you utter. So keep asking. He‚Äôs All-Hearing!\n",
      "When you find yourself in a certain situation which you never expected, don‚Äôt ask why. Accept it as part of the Almighty‚Äôs Plan. Keep your focus. Keep going. The Almighty knows what‚Äôs best for you even if you find it unpalatable. Looking back, you‚Äôll be grateful it happened!\n",
      "Spread this far and wide. Someone else‚Äôs success doesn‚Äôt equate your failure! Let‚Äôs break this ugly cycle and remember that the Almighty rewards each and everyone of us differently. Start being genuinely happy for others. Learn to cheer them on. Your turn will come!\n",
      "Friends come and go, some leave footprints in your life while others leave unspeakable scars. Remember, a friend who tries to please everyone is a friend to none. They‚Äôll keep mum when you‚Äôre wrongfully accused &amp; most definitely not be on your side when the time comes! Beware!\n",
      "Stop hating your body. Start  living life. Don‚Äôt believe what you see on social media that‚Äôs been doctored, filtered, photoshopped. What you consider flaws are celebrated by others. Your body‚Äôs a gift from the Almighty. He‚Äôs made you in the best form. So take good care of it!\n",
      "Replace fear with faith. Worry with worship. Panic with peace. Always remember that the Almighty is totally in control. Surrender your insecurities, your nagging doubts and innermost fears to Him. He will set them right for you and your heart will find tranquility once again.\n",
      "You‚Äôll be content if you make this your life motto. If you‚Äôre below others, push them up. If they are by your side, guide them along. If you‚Äôre above them, reach out &amp; give them a leg up. It‚Äôs not easy. It requires a sincere heart. You‚Äôll attract so much goodness into your life!\n",
      "Why do we always have to focus on what‚Äôs wrong, what‚Äôs bad, what‚Äôs lacking? Can we for a change, focus on the beauty that exists in the world even during these challenging times? Perhaps that‚Äôs why the Almighty made us all stay home to reflect on the blessings we have!\n",
      "Understand the Almighty‚Äôs Plan. If you‚Äôve done your best &amp; things still don‚Äôt work out, move on. Know that He has something better for you. You may not be able to see it at that point in time, but that‚Äôs when you need firm faith. Better things and better days are ahead. Trust!\n",
      "It‚Äôs natural to fear the unknown. As humans, we don‚Äôt have the answers to everything, but we must trust that the Almighty has planned our next step. Always remember that He who has brought us this far, will see us through every difficulty that comes our way!\n",
      "Do you determine your worth by the size of your bank balance? Nothing material will bring you what you‚Äôre looking for. If you want a life of abundance, start with gratitude. Always be thankful. Find it in your heart to be happy for others. You‚Äôll attract a lot more blessings!\n",
      "Almighty. Calm our troubled hearts and let peace and tranquility reign once again. There‚Äôs so much noise and confusion around us that it‚Äôs easy to be distracted and lose focus. Many useless things demand our attention. Guide us. Keep us firm in faith; always close to You! Aameen!\n",
      "Do your best to always use the best words when speaking to others &amp; not to resort to insults, name-calling &amp; harshness. This is even more important in the age of the internet! Today, many don‚Äôt give a second thought to what they say &amp; write! Remember you‚Äôll be held accountable!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt let sadness consume you. What's this life but a mixture of sad &amp; happy moments. Nothing lasts. That‚Äôs how it is. No matter what the Almighty places in your path, keep putting one foot in front of the other, even when it hurts. Trust that He only wants what‚Äôs good for you!\n",
      "Trials are a gift from the Almighty. The hardship you‚Äôre experiencing might just be what earns His Pleasure. It might just be your ticket to Paradise. He‚Äôs watching to see if it softens your hardened heart; if it makes you admit He is the source of everything. He is in control.\n",
      "The truth is we‚Äôre being favoured daily. The Almighty bestows His many blessings on us in various forms but often we don‚Äôt see them. The closed doors He‚Äôs protecting us from, opening new doors &amp; opportunities, the new people He brings forth or removes from our lives. Thank Him!\n",
      "RT @muftimenk: When haters find no fault to pick on then even the way you breathe becomes an issue.\n",
      "Don‚Äôt beat yourself over something that happened in the past. Repent, seek forgiveness, move on. We all sin; we all make mistakes. But the best are those who learn from their shortcomings, focus on becoming a better version of themselves, leaving no time for futile activities!\n",
      "When the Almighty takes something away from you, do you wallow in self-pity, thinking negative thoughts or do you have firm belief that He will replace it with something better? If you understood His Plan, you‚Äôll be ever hopeful what‚Äôs to come will be better than what‚Äôs gone!\n",

      "Be mindful of the people you allow into your inner circle. Make sure you‚Äôre familiar with every one of them. Make sure the people in your boat are rowing in the same direction as you are. Remember, it‚Äôs better to be alone than to be with those who‚Äôll jeopardise your Hereafter!\n",
      "Whatever you‚Äôre going through, know that nothing is too big for the Lord of the Worlds. There‚Äôs no promise He can‚Äôt fulfill, no prayer He can‚Äôt answer, no obstacle He can‚Äôt remove, no heart He can‚Äôt mend, no illness He can‚Äôt heal &amp; the list goes on! Stay encouraged; stay focused!\n",
      "Growth is usually uncomfortable. It‚Äôs human nature to resist it because it takes you out of your comfort zone to a different version of yourself. So don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. Cut yourself some slack, say a prayer. You‚Äôll get there sooner or later if you set your mind to it!\n",
      "Trust the Almighty to remove certain people from your life because they no longer serve a purpose. Accept it and allow Him to bring in new people into your life for the next stage of your growth. It may seem daunting but He knows what He‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôs your leap of faith!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt waste your time confiding in others e when you have a problem. It‚Äôs been shown most don‚Äôt care. The rest wished you had it worse &amp; only a small number feel sorry! Turn to the Almighty who is always there for you. He‚Äôs the Best Listener. What more do you need!\n",
      "Focus on where you‚Äôre headed. Where you‚Äôve been is the past. Don‚Äôt waste your energy reliving those times. There‚Äôs a reason the Almighty has brought you to where you are right now. Remember, sometimes those with the worst past have created the best future! Don‚Äôt lose hope!\n",
      "The Almighty will bring you what you need. Don‚Äôt doubt that. Turn to Him. Cry. Beg. Ask for guidance, understanding, relief, forgiveness etc. Never underestimate the power of repeating your supplications with beautiful patience. Keep asking with full hope &amp; you shall receive!\n",
      "When you appreciate yourself, it becomes easier to appreciate others. When you lack self-acceptance, that‚Äôs when you have enemies. How else can you accept other people‚Äôs uniqueness if you can‚Äôt honour yours. Be true to yourself. Your journey is yours alone. Don‚Äôt imitate others!\n",
      "You are what you focus on. What thoughts do you entertain in your head? What you allow to grow there will be your centre of focus. If you think positive thoughts, you‚Äôll attract positivity into your life. That‚Äôs how it works. Don‚Äôt let negativity creep in! Do it consciously!\n",

      "If you've gained a million likes by posting something disliked by the Almighty then you've lost! Leave a legacy you‚Äôll be proud of on the Day you meet your Maker! Be responsible. Avoid anything immoral or sinful. If you can‚Äôt be responsible, then it's time to uninstall some apps.\n",
      "Do yourself a favour. If you‚Äôre doing something to show off, don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs futile really. You might bask in momentary glory and people will admite you etc but honestly, it means nothing to the Almighty! It‚Äôs His validation that you need. That‚Äôs the only thing that matters!\n",

      "Don‚Äôt look for quick fix solutions. Short cuts will get you nowhere at least in your personal development. Moreover, quick fixes often backfire. The road to improving ourselves is one that‚Äôs long, continuous &amp; persistent. It requires time, commitment, self discipline &amp; hard work.\n",
      "Are you among those who‚Äôll spend most of your time fixing other people‚Äôs problems but your life‚Äôs a mess? Remember, charity begins at home. The best way to help others is to help yourself first. Invest your time in being a better version of yourself; everything else will follow.\n",
      "Stop sweating the small stuff. Always remember how short this life is. All it takes is a split second for things to change. Learn to be grateful. Focus on His blessings no matter how small it is. The happiest people don‚Äôt have everything but they make the most of what they have.\n",
      "Don‚Äôt be surprised if people try to detour you from your path when you‚Äôre doing well and headed in the right direction. It‚Äôs a normal human trait. Recognize it. Know their game and be on full alert. Stand your ground politely but firmly. Do what you must and don‚Äôt be distracted.\n",
      "Almighty. Grant us the strength &amp; the courage to carry on. A lot‚Äôs going on around us &amp; it‚Äôs easy to become despondent. Our energy &amp; motivation are constantly being tested.

      "If your heart is not in the right place, you‚Äôll never feel at ease. Purify your intenion in everything that you do. In this age of social media it‚Äôs easy to show off, get carried away &amp; thrive on exaggerated needs for acceptance &amp; validation. Protect your heart at all times.\n",
      "The Almighty is the Controller of Hearts. He can change things in the blink of an eye. Don‚Äôt forget! He can heal what has been hurting for years in a flash. He can forgive as He wills. Nothing is beyond the Lord of the Worlds. Have faith that things will work out in the end.\n",
      "Pay heed to whatever comes out of your mouth. Every word you utter matters. It really does. You may not think so but trust me when I say that the power of words is immense. It can make you or break you. It has the ability to change someone‚Äôs life! Choose your words carefully!\n",
      "Man is always comparing. We often feel the other person is in a much better state than we are. Instead of accepting &amp; appreciating what we have, we always find a way to look at what others have. Be wary. In trying to achieve something better, one may end up losing what one has!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt worry about how people act. That‚Äôs on them not you. Always choose kindness, that‚Äôs under your control. Spread it far and wide, whichever way you can, even if it means giving a smile or a word of encouragement. Never underestimate how contagious being kind can be!\n",
      "Learn to see the best in people. Believe the best about them too. No matter how much you disagree, try to find common ground. Spread peace. Quit fighting and bickering. Build bridges. Don‚Äôt hate. Don‚Äôt look down on anyone. Life‚Äôs too short to be doing otherwise.\n",
      "Quit stressing yourself unnecessarily. If you‚Äôve done your best, then leave it to the Almighty. If something‚Äôs out of your hands, it deserves freedom from your mind too!  Overthinking is not going to change it. Let Him work it out for you. Be prepared for the best outcome!\n",
      "Big changes can be made in small steps. If you want the change to last, then you need more than a \"just do it\" mentality. It needs to be slowly cultivated till it becomes part of you. Then pray hard &amp; ask the Almighty to guide you. If anyone can help, it's the One who made you!\n",
      "Be wary of greed. And it‚Äôs not just about money. You can be greedy for material possessions, fame, compliments etc. Whatever it is, greed is a spiritual disease of the heart and is always destructive. So work on your heart to drive greed out. Learn to share, give generously!\n",
      "The Almighty‚Äôs not only the source of love but the only One truly worthy of love! People will always let us down. Impermissible relationships will end in heartbreak. That‚Äôs why when we give them our hearts completely, we end up suffering heartbreak after heartbreak! Take heed!\n",
      "Do you live your life to please others? If so, you‚Äôll never know peace because nothing you do will be good enough. If you make decisions based on what others will think of you, it‚Äôs time for a rethink! Where does the Almighty figure in your life? Reflect! Live your life for Him\n",

      "Remember, Satan works the hardest when you‚Äôre about to make a breakthrough. You need to hold on to your faith, stay the course &amp; draw yourself even closer to the Almighty. Resist the temptation, ignore the whispers; keep fighting. Build a barrier by seeking refuge in your Maker!\n",
      "Go out of your way to become a humble person. Yes! Cultivate humility. Do it with a passion. Life will test you with anything &amp; everything. It‚Äôs easy to be humble when being tested &amp; trying to cope. But staying humble when the Almighty‚Äôs blessed you reveals your true self!\n",

      "Whenever we find something that irritates us about others, it‚Äôs time to look inward, scrutinise ourselves. The tendency is to look outward. Resist the temptation. Remember, your reaction is about you. Your bias, your judgement, your prejudice. You‚Äôll end up hurting yourself.\n",
      "Nothing lasts. The same goes for people who come into your life to show you a thing or two. Remember, no one crosses your path unless it‚Äôs planned by the Almighty. It doesn‚Äôt happen by accident. So cherish the moments you have with them because not everyone will stay forever.\n",
      "Learn to listen to your own voice; your own heart; your own soul. Focus on that regardless of what others might tell you. Why? Because there‚Äôs too much noise around us, loud decibels accosting us daily. Sadly, people tend to listen to all that noise instead of themselves!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt be jealous when you see someone having more than you. Remember, the Almighty blesses us differently. Don‚Äôt compare. Instead show gratitude so He can bless you with even more. Never forget that He has given you so much already; honestly, you‚Äôll never be able to count them!\n",
      "Do you feel angry or resentful when being corrected or shown the truth? If you do, then you have a problem with pride! Be wary because even a atom‚Äôs weight of it can bar you from Paradise! So work on your heart. Purify it. Humble yourself to people. Get rid of self-importance!\n",
      "Some people feel a little lost when they don‚Äôt get enough attention from others. So they make fun of people, belittle them and say nasty things about them in order to get the attention they so badly desire. Try to counsel them if you can. Say a prayer for them. They need it!\n",
      "Remember, the Almighty does not expect us to have all the answers. He knows, as humans, our knowledge is limited. But that‚Äôs no excuse for not seeking knowledge. He expects us to learn; have unwavering faith in Him; knowing that He‚Äôs always there &amp; that He rewards those who try!\n",
      "Do you often feel confused &amp; unsettled? Perhaps your heart feels like something‚Äôs amiss? Learn to cultivate inner peace by drawing yourself closer to the Almighty. Trust Him completely. He will guide you through it all. He will show you where you need to go to feel whole again!\n",
      "Don‚Äôt be foolish and expose every blessing the Almighty has given you to everyone and think that they‚Äôll be happy for you. The truth is some will but many won‚Äôt. The evil eye is real. Learn to keep things private and not to share too much with those who could possibly harm you.\n",
      "If you‚Äôre always looking for ways to expose others, you have a problem that needs fixing. Remember, the Almighty said if you expose others, He‚Äôll surely expose you, even if you‚Äôre hiding in the tiniest corner of the room. If you have good intentions, do it privately not publicly!\n",
      "Whatever you‚Äôre facing right now, whatever you‚Äôre dealing with won‚Äôt last. Nothing does. So get a perspective on life. Things will get better. That‚Äôs the Almighty‚Äôs promise. Tomorrow brings new hope. Daybreak will happen. Get hold of yourself and keep moving. You‚Äôll get there!\n",
      "You‚Äôre allowed to disagree with others, state your opinion respectfully but NEVER get physical or violent. This quality makes us distinct from animals! Be civilised, listen to what others are saying but avoid knee-jerk reactions. It would save you from a whole lot of regret!\n"

      "Her preservation work extended to the areas surrounding the White House as well, as Mrs. Kennedy saved historic Lafayette Square from demolition.\n\nImage Credit: Library of Congress https://t.co/QOX9EBc14u\n",
      "In 1962, Mrs. Kennedy oversaw the publication of the first White House guidebook for tourists and led a T.V. tour of the White House, bringing the rich history of the People‚Äôs House to household audiences.\n\nImage Credit: John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum / NARA https://t.co/x3utyJRSVo\n",
      "As a result, the historical furnishings and artwork are now considered the property of the United States government and must remain primarily in the White House or its permanent collection.\n\nImage Credit: John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum / NARA https://t.co/FRTqSodmGN\n",
      "Perhaps most importantly, Mrs. Kennedy‚Äôs efforts to protect the integrity of the mansion‚Äôs historical rooms led to the passage of Public Law 87-286 in September 1961, which established the ‚Äúmuseum character‚Äù of the White House.\n",
      "In 1961, she founded the White House Historical Association to preserve the White House and sharing its history with the American public. Kennedy also dedicated herself to restoring the State Floor rooms of the White House, using antique furnishings, artifacts, and art pieces.\n",
      "Though John F. Kennedy‚Äôs administration was tragically cut short in 1963, Mrs. Kennedy made an incomparable mark on the White House for future presidents, first ladies, and the American people.\n\nImage Credit: John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum / NARA https://t.co/QSozS8lHh1\n",
